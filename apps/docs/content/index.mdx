## Introduction

Nuvra-UI is a minimal, lightweight component library for React and Tailwind CSS. It provides the essential building blocks for your application without the typical overhead. Instead of fighting a rigid design system, you get flexible, unstyled components: your design, your way.

## Why Nuvra-UI?

Nuvra-UI is a lightweight set of components designed to stay out of your way. Build flexible, unstyled components: your design, your way.
